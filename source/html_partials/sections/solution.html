  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>For the iPhone app, we were essentially able to translate the functions of the website into a meaningful, understandable mobile context. Users can still continue to modify their contributions, view their portfolio, allocate funds, and update beneficiaries.</p>

  <p>For the Apple Watch app, we recognized that the solution would be less immersive than the iOS version, but engaging nonetheless. Using Sketch, we collaborated with the Empower design team to create a user interface inspired by the mobile app, at the same, adhering to Apple’s UI standards for the watch.</p>

  <p>After finalizing the designs with Empower, we used Origami to create a high-fidelity prototype. Origami is a prototyping tool created by Facebook; it has a large library of customizable, built-in animations and interactions. It’s an industry-leading tool that we’ve used on several occasions to create engaging and visually enticing apps.</p>

  <p>We also had to pinpoint what aspects of one’s retirement account users would want easy access to on their wrist.</p>
