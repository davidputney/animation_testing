The Apple Watch integrates biometric and passcode security, allowing users to decide whether or not the app deploys on the watch. We also conceived opt-in controls within the iOS app allowing the user to disable the view that displays account balances on the Apple Watch.

Getting back to the basics while embracing wearable, emerging technology was a daunting challenge, but one where our team rose to meet it head on. Empower Retirement was pleased to receive our completed product within the six-week deadline. The app is now available in the App Store where over 8 million participants can download and use it.

Many people saving for retirement are not actively involved in investing their own money, and even more people who check on their accounts only a few times a year. The Empower Apple Watch app changes that model, by providing a holistic user experience from the beginning of saving for retirement, until the day the clock hits zero.
