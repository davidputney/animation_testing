  Working with Empower, we identified four aspects of the Apple Watch app that fits with their mission to keep people actively involved in their retirement accounts.

  <ul id="watch-anim-list" class="watch-anim-list">
    <li id="face-1-list" class="fade-in">
      Display a user’s progress toward achieving their retirement income goal
    </li>
    <li id="face-2-list" class="fade-in">
      Show current balances and value of their investments
    </li>
    <li id="face-3-list" class="fade-in">
      Provide simple notifications that users can respond to from the Apple Watch
    </li>
    <li id="face-4-list" class="fade-in">
      Make retirement planning playful by displaying a countdown clock that projects how many days remain to the user’s retirement date
    </li>
  </ul>
